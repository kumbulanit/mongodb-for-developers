### How to Use Tailable Cursors

To use a tailable cursor, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Capped Collection**:
   You first need to create a capped collection. You can do this using the following command in the MongoDB shell:
   ```javascript
   db.createCollection("myCappedCollection", { capped: true, size: 100000 });
   ```
   This creates a capped collection named `myCappedCollection` with a maximum size of 100,000 bytes.

2. **Insert Documents**:
   Insert some documents into the capped collection:
   ```javascript
   db.myCappedCollection.insert({ message: "First message" });
   db.myCappedCollection.insert({ message: "Second message" });
   ```

3. **Create a Tailable Cursor**:
   You can create a tailable cursor to listen for new documents:
   ```javascript
   var cursor = db.myCappedCollection.find().addOption(DBCursor.Option.tailable);
   ```

4. **Iterate Over the Cursor**:
   You can iterate over the cursor to read new documents:
   ```javascript
   while (cursor.hasNext()) {
       printjson(cursor.next());
   }
   ```

5. **Blocking Behavior**:
   If you want the cursor to block until new documents are available, you can use the `awaitData` option:
   ```javascript
   var cursor = db.myCappedCollection.find().addOption(DBCursor.Option.tailable).addOption(DBCursor.Option.awaitData);
   ```

### Use Cases for Tailable Cursors

- **Logging Systems**: Tailable cursors are often used in logging systems where you want to stream logs as they are generated.
- **Real-Time Notifications**: Applications that need to push real-time notifications to users can benefit from using tailable cursors.
- **Event-Driven Architectures**: In microservices or event-driven systems, tailable cursors can help services respond to events as they happen.

### Limitations

- **Only for Capped Collections**: Tailable cursors can only be used with capped collections, limiting their use cases.
- **No Backtracking**: Once a document is read, it cannot be returned again in the same cursor.
- **No Indexes on Capped Collections**: Capped collections do not support creating secondary indexes, which can limit query capabilities.

### Summary

Tailable cursors in MongoDB provide a powerful mechanism for streaming real-time data from capped collections. They are ideal for applications that require continuous updates, such as logging and event notification systems. Understanding how to effectively use tailable cursors can enhance the responsiveness and interactivity of your MongoDB applications.
